Forge compatible World Downloader
=================================

Port of dslake's World Downloader (https://github.com/dslake/WorldDownloader). No vanilla class are modified. Compatible with FTB unleashed.

This version is for people playing on 1.5.2 servers using Forge. It has been tested and works on FTB Unleashed. Any other 1.5.2 FTB should be compatible too.

THIS VERSION IS STILL IN BETA

Installation
------------
Like any other forge mod, place it in your mods folder and it's ready to go !

This mod is only client side, so you don't need to alter your server's jar

Usage
-----
In the 'ESC' menu, click on "Download this world". Every loaded chunk will be saved, and if you move, new chunk will be saved as well.

To stop downloading, click on "Stop Download" in the 'ESC' menu.

Downloading Storage
-------------------
The server will not always send you the content of a chest or any other storage (for FTB users).

To make sure that your storage content will be downloaded, just open your chests. The server will always send you the content in that case.

Applied Energetics users : to download the content of your ME systems, open your ME drive blocks.


Upcoming Features
-----------------
 - Multiworld support
 - Better tile entities support 
 - 1.6+ support (maybe)
